# Guild Bank Audit
A tool for players who want to manage their guild banks outside of the game. The addon will output a compiled list of all items with a complete count of each item. 
The idea was to save hours of manual data entry into a spreadsheet, and create away to do it with one copy & paste!

All commands can be used with "/gba", "/gbank", or "/guildbankaudit" followed by one of the following commands:
- all -> scans the entire bank and displays entire output. You must manually click each tab within your guild bank, the addon cant see what hasnt been loaded.
- tab -> scans the current selected tab
- help -> displays a version of this in game
- bugged -> displays a window with the link to report any bugs
